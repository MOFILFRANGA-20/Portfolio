        <p class="Para">A passionate and self-motivated web development enthusiast, I bring a strong foundation in
            front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, along with a solid understanding of Java
            programming. I have a keen eye for design and functionality, which allows me to create responsive,
            user-friendly websites that deliver a seamless user experience across devices. My ability to translate ideas
            into functional, aesthetically pleasing web solutions reflects my dedication to quality and performance. In
            addition to my technical skills, I possess a strong grasp of programming logic, enabling me to solve
            problems efficiently and implement dynamic features in web applications. I am always eager to explore new
            tools and frameworks, continuously enhancing my knowledge to stay updated with the evolving web development
